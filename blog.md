## Onboarding, Git, and Github
Whew! What a week. I had expected to be challenged but I wasn’t prepared for this. There is so much information coming at you from all sides it can be overwhelming. I have to admit, I got sucked down a hole once or twice, surfacing 5 hours later after finding myself clicking that next link that would finally tell me the etymological origins of of the ~ in coding languages. It’s a trap I tell you! Anyway, it has been challenging but rewarding as well.

<br><img align="right" width="200" height="140" src="https://github.com/sflittrell/sflittrell.github.io/blob/dev/img/FrustrationImage.jpg?raw=true"> One of the first things all of us here in the Bootcamp truly experienced was the philosophy of *fail fast, fail often, fail forward*. This first week was filled with quite a few stumbles and failures. Working with Git in terminal was one such example. It seemed like an insurmountable tangle of confusion. All the commands, pushing and pulling, incorporating VS Code, talking with Github. Blah! It made my head hurt.<br>

At first I saw Git as a program that we would be using to create projects, but then I had an epiphany! Git was a simple, iterative file system not some mysterious, all powerful programing behemoth. All it did was store and keep track of changes you make to files and folders, changes made **using other tools**. Git wasn’t the tool itself! Once I realized that, everything started to come together. Little concepts and ideas started to fall into place and the real work of learning could begin. Not to say everything was peaches and cream. There were still some stumbling blocks here and there, but they didn’t feel insurmountable. I had the confidence to move forward because I had failed and overcome.<br>

This first week has been a challenge but also fun. Does that make me a masochist? Who knows. Let's jump off that cliff together. Until next week.

## HTML and CSS
So, week two of Bootcamp has come and gone and I’m feeling much more confident in myself and the experience. The second week was all about HTML and CSS. This week seemed a little liter then last. I think because I have had some experience in using it over the years. It was a great opportunity to refresh myself on HTML and learn a lot more about CSS. I can now see the potential and power of CSS for formatting and styling a site.

There wasn’t as much of a struggle this week as there was last. Don’t get me wrong, there were some missteps but most of those come down to my own carelessness, misspellings, typos, simple errors. I think I need to learn to be more patient and not rush to finish. It’s about the learning **process** and not the finished product.

I am eager to learn more about CSS and stretch some of those creative muscles. Really get in there and design something great. I am also excited (and a little nervous) to start using Github collaboratively and see how the workflow works.
